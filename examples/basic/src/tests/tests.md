# Tests - Make your code Bulletproof!

In this directory, you can create tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of your code. Each test file should be a standard C program. 

To create tests:
1. Include a `main` function in your test file.
2. Write multiple functions to represent your test cases.
3. You can include the `<assert.h>` header to facilitate easier validation of your test cases.

Writing comprehensive tests helps you identify and resolve issues early in the development process, ensuring the stability and robustness of your codebase.
