# Libraries - Manage Your Dependencies

This directory is dedicated to managing your dependencies. You can include existing C libraries or create your own. Here's where you'll add the `.c` and accompanying `.h` files for your C dependencies. The Makefile will automatically include the necessary files from this folder.

To add a dependency:
1. Place the `.c` and `.h` files in this directory.
2. Update the Makefile to include the dependency in the compilation process.

Make sure to organize your dependencies properly for easy maintenance and reuse.
