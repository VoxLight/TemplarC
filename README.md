This robust yet straightforward template provides a setup to get your C code running in YOUR environment, with YOUR rules, in NO time flat! 

## Key Features 🔑

### 🧰 Dependency Handling
TemplarC empowers you to write your own dependencies inside of the `libs` folder. Just make sure each `.c` file you write has a corresponding header file.

### 🧪 Automatic Testing
Writing test cases is as easy as pie with TemplarC! Just write a `.c` file in the `tests` directory to test your dependencies. The best part? When you run `make test`, all dependencies are auto-calculated, meaning you only include the files you need!
